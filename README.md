### Introduction
Before we jump into the main project, let’s get you up to speed on some Deep Learning basics—especially Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Here’s a handy list of resources to get you familiar with the theory and help you start building prediction models. Dive in when you're ready!

**Learning Resources**
1. **If You’re New to Machine Learning:**
   - Introduction to Basic ML Algorithms: [Infinite Codes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Hmnixke2g)
   - Overview of Key ML Concepts: [Josh Starmer's Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLblh5JKOoLUICTaGLRoHQDuF_7q2GfuJF) — select only the relevant videos.
2. **Neural Networks:**
    - Neural Networks & Backpropagation & some Calculus: [3Blue1Brown's Neural Networks playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) (Chapters 1–4)
    - Intro to CNNs : [Futurology's CNN visualization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pj9-rr1wDhM)
3. **Diving into RNNs:**
    - RNN and LSTM Concepts: [Josh Starmer's Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLblh5JKOoLUICTaGLRoHQDuF_7q2GfuJF) (Videos 85–87)

> Note: It’s perfectly fine if you don’t fully grasp every theoretical concept on the first pass. Don’t spend too much time trying to understand every detail—familiarity with the core ideas is enough for now. Go ahead with the coding tutorials, the concepts will naturally start to make more sense.
